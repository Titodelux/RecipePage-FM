## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Losing the fear of failure, one of the things that prevented me from touching frontend development again, I was very satisfied with the result taking into account the amount of time I did not use HTML and CSS. I learned the benefits of a reset-css, the interaction of margins with others, how to manipulate the ::marker pseudoclass, among other things.

### Continued development

I am going to continue developing frontend applications to be able to implement in my portfolio, master flexbox, grids, id's, among other things.
